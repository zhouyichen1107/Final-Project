# Final-Project

Wearing face masks is one of the essential means to prevent the transmission of certain respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Although acceptance of such masks is increasing in the Western hemisphere, many people feel that social interaction is affected by wearing a mask. From my sociology class, I have read an article titled “[Wearing Face Masks Strongly Confuses Counterparts in Reading Emotions.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.566886)” written by  Claus-Christian Carbon, and I learned that the existence of a mask affects emotional reading, as evidenced by reduced accuracy and trust in one's own judgment of the revealed emotions. We often have a hard time deciphering people' feelings through their limited facial expression wearing masks, as seen in the article and in our daily lives. However, we are wondering whether the capability of machine (Amazon Rekognition) to read emotions will be affected with facial coverings. We also investigate to what extend the capability will be affected.
